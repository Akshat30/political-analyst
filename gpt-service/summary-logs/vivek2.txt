William (00:00):In the crowded race for the Republican presidential nomination, there are governors, a senator, even a former president. Then there’s Vivek Ramaswamy, a first time candidate who has spent millions of his own money to capture the attention of primary voters, and as of now, it seems to be paying off. He’s polling higher than many of his competitors who have far more political experience. Lisa Desjardins has our conversation.Lisa Desjardins (00:25):William, Ramaswamy will share the stage with several of those candidates at the first GOP debate next month, after his campaign announced recently that he has met the fundraising and polling qualifications. Before jumping into politics, Ramaswamy ran a biotech company, managed a hedge fund, authored books including Woke Inc, and made regular appearances on conservative media. The son of Indian immigrants, Ramaswamy is clear and vocal on the campaign trail, criticizing the left on cultural issues and pledging to pardon Donald Trump, just 37 years old. He’s also hoping to be the youngest president in American history and Vivek Ramaswamy joins me now. The big question, why should Republicans choose you as their nominee?Vivek Ramaswamy (01:07):I think I’m best positioned to advance our America first agenda, take it even further than Trump did, but also unite the country in the process. I think we live in an interesting moment today in the year 2023. I think it’s a 1776 moment. If you want incremental reform, there are plenty of other candidates who promised to offer that. I stand on the side of revolution, the American Revolution. Reviving those 1776 ideals today when it comes to shutting down the administrative state, restoring three branches of government rather than four, declaring independence from our enemy, communist China, reviving national pride in the next generation, growing the economy. I think I’m the candidate best positioned to achieve these things because I’m delivering on my own vision of how to actually accomplish them, and that’s why I’m in this race.Lisa Desjardins (01:59):As you and our viewers know, former President Trump has a massive lead right now in polls about the Republican race. I want to ask you who other than President Trump do you think is your next toughest competition and what makes you a better candidate than former President Trump and that other person?Vivek Ramaswamy (02:16):I think there’s only two candidates who matter in this Republican primary that’s President Trump and myself. I went from 0.0% now to polling third nationally, second in one national poll that came out last week. So I think very soon this is going to be a two horse race between Trump and myself. I think the question is this, who’s going to actually take our America first agenda even further? I think he was a good president. I agree with many, if not most of his policies. But the reality is that about 30% of this country suffers from psychiatric illness when he’s in the White House. People start to disagree with policies they otherwise would’ve agreed with just because he’s the one advancing them.(02:57)And my question is for the Republican bases, who’s your actual loyalty to? If it is to this country, then ask who’s going to advance that agenda even further. I’ve said I would secure the southern border, not just by building the wall, but by using the US military to secure the southern border. I’m achieving more than Trump did with our own shared agenda to put this country first, but at the same time uniting the country in the process.Lisa Desjardins (03:23):Well, let me ask you. I hear you talking about trying to unite the country, but you’re also talking about pushing an agenda further from a man who you say people suffered under in some form. What does that mean, pushing that agenda further and how is that better for the country?Vivek Ramaswamy (03:38):I think the way we get to national unity is not by compromising on our principles. I think it is about being uncompromising about the principles that set this nation into motion 250 years ago. Principles like self-governance over aristocracy, principles like the pursuit of excellence and meritocracy. The idea that you get ahead in this country, not on the color of your skin, but on the content of your character and your contribution.Lisa Desjardins (04:05):Let me ask you about that. You know, I know that you are someone who opposes affirmative action. You and I have talked about this and you told me that you don’t see a difference in opportunity for people based on color in this country. But we do know, data say that black mothers and babies are more likely to die at a rate of two to three times those of whites. We also know when it comes to income, for example, that blacks and Hispanics often earn on average a third less than whites. Where do you think those disparities come from and how would you as president address them?Vivek Ramaswamy (04:38):They come from disparities in the fatherlessness epidemic across this country. 25% of kids, sadly, of all skin colors, are born into fatherless homes in the United States of America today. Those kids are eight times more likely to end up in jail, in poverty. Those kids are more likely to suffer from mental health disorders later in life, to underperform in schools regardless of what race they are. Now, let’s actually take a look at the racial disparities. It’s upwards of 50%, 40 plus percent of black kids born into single parent households. For Asian American kids, it’s single digits. That’s what explains the difference in achievement, not systemic racism. That’s the problem we need to fix.Lisa Desjardins (05:21):I want to do come back to former President Trump. You have said that candidates should pledge to pardon him in his classified documents case. We now expect an indictment for him related to January 6th. Does your pardon approach extend to his role on January 6th and how would you describe his role in fueling that day?Vivek Ramaswamy (05:42):I’m guided by the facts and the law, so if that indictment should be issued, I would read it before making a commitment on a pardon. I did read the first two indictments, both Alvin Bragg’s disastrous and politically tortured indictment in the state of New York, invoking federal law to bring a local case. And then also I did read the documents case, and I think in both of those instances, those are politicized persecutions.Lisa Desjardins (06:06):And on January 6th?Vivek Ramaswamy (06:07):So on January 6th, I’d have to read the indictment to say, but I personally, based on the facts that I’m aware of, think that it would be a mistake to bring that indictment. I would have, to be clear in each of these instances, made very different judgements than Trump did. I wouldn’t have handled those documents in the same way. I would’ve handled January 6th very differently had I been in the White House instead of him. But a bad judgment, even a very bad judgment is not the same thing as a crime. And when we start to conflate the two, I think that is a dangerous precedent for the political weaponization of police power in this country and I think that’s going to take us in the wrong direction. Closer to a national divorce when I actually want to lead us forward to a national revival.Lisa Desjardins (06:50):You are number three in national Republican polls, but some of your views on things like abortion, affirmative action, those are out of step with where independence and some swing voters are nationally. How do you win in November?Vivek Ramaswamy (07:04):Actually, respectfully disagree with you on that because there’s something fundamentally un-American about using racial quota systems. I think the same comes to securing the southern border, most Americans are on the side of actually doing it. So when you look at my top policy measures for this country, I think more Americans are actually united around the basic principles, and that’s why I’m confident we are going to deliver a Ronald Reagan style mandate and electoral mandate, a landslide like Reagan did in 1980. That’s what I’m delivering in 2024. If that was the Reagan Revolution back then, it’s the Ramaswamy Revolution this time around. I’m confident that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver.Lisa Desjardins (07:42):Vivek Ramaswamy candidate for President. Thank you for talking with us.Vivek Ramaswamy (07:45):Thank you.

Summary:

The speech transcript features an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy, a first-time candidate running for the Republican presidential nomination. The interview touches on various topics, including Ramaswamy's qualifications, his stance on issues, and his views on former President Trump. 

Biases and Inaccuracies:

1. Biases: The interviewer introduces Ramaswamy as a candidate who has spent millions of his own money to capture the attention of primary voters, implying that his financial investment is a significant factor in his success. This statement may be biased as it suggests that money is the primary determinant of a candidate's popularity.

2. Biases: The interviewer mentions that Ramaswamy is polling higher than many of his competitors who have more political experience. This statement may be biased as it implies that political experience is the sole indicator of a candidate's suitability for the nomination.

3. Inaccuracies: The interviewer states that Ramaswamy has met the fundraising and polling qualifications for the first GOP debate next month. However, the transcript does not provide any evidence or specific details to support this claim.

4. Biases: Ramaswamy describes himself as the candidate best positioned to advance the "America first" agenda and unite the country. This statement may be biased as it assumes that his agenda is the best and that he is capable of achieving unity.

5. Biases: Ramaswamy suggests that former President Trump's presence in the White House caused people to disagree with policies they would have otherwise agreed with. This statement may be biased as it assumes that disagreement with policies is solely due to Trump's involvement.

6. Inaccuracies: Ramaswamy claims that disparities in income and health outcomes among different racial groups are primarily due to disparities in fatherlessness. This claim oversimplifies complex social and economic factors that contribute to these disparities.

7. Biases: Ramaswamy opposes affirmative action and suggests that racial disparities in achievement are not due to systemic racism but rather to differences in family structure. This statement may be biased as it overlooks the historical and ongoing effects of systemic racism on marginalized communities.

8. Inaccuracies: Ramaswamy states that most Americans are united around his policy measures, such as securing the southern border. This claim lacks evidence and may not accurately reflect the diversity of opinions among Americans.

Extent of Objective Content vs. Biases/Inaccuracies:

Approximately 60% of the transcript can be considered objective content rooted in facts, while the remaining 40% contains biases, inconsistencies, and false information. The most biased points include the portrayal of Ramaswamy's financial investment as a significant factor in his success, the assumption that political experience is the sole indicator of suitability for the nomination, and the oversimplification of complex issues such as racial disparities and the causes of disagreement with policies.

Summary:

The speech transcript provided features an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy, a first-time candidate running for the Republican presidential nomination. The interview touches on various topics, including Ramaswamy's qualifications, his stance on key issues, and his views on former President Trump. 

Biases and Inaccuracies:

1. Biases:
- The interviewer introduces Ramaswamy as a candidate who has spent millions of his own money to capture the attention of primary voters, implying that his financial investment is a significant factor in his success. This bias suggests that money plays a crucial role in political campaigns.
- The interviewer mentions that Ramaswamy is polling higher than many of his competitors who have more political experience, suggesting that his polling numbers are a testament to his qualifications. This bias overlooks other potential factors that may influence polling results.
- Ramaswamy is described as clear and vocal on the campaign trail, criticizing the left on cultural issues. This bias suggests that his criticism of the left is a positive attribute without providing any context or counterarguments.

2. Inconsistencies:
- Ramaswamy claims to be the candidate best positioned to achieve various goals, such as shutting down the administrative state, restoring three branches of government, and declaring independence from China. However, he does not provide specific plans or evidence to support these claims, making them inconsistent and unsubstantiated.

3. False Information:
- Ramaswamy states that about 30% of the country suffers from psychiatric illness when former President Trump is in the White House. This claim is false and lacks any evidence or credible sources to support it.
- Ramaswamy argues that there is no difference in opportunity based on color in the United States, despite data showing disparities in areas such as maternal and infant mortality rates and income levels. This claim contradicts well-documented evidence and is misleading.

Extent of Objective Content vs. Biases/Inaccuracies:
Approximately 60% of the content can be considered objective and rooted in facts, while the remaining 40% contains biases, inconsistencies, and false information. The biases are most evident in the introduction of Ramaswamy and the portrayal of his qualifications and success. The false information is present in Ramaswamy's claim about psychiatric illness and his denial of racial disparities in opportunity.

How do you win in November?Vivek Ramaswamy (07:04):Actually, respectfully disagree with you on that because there’s something fundamentally un-American about using racial quota systems. So when you look at my top policy measures for this country, I think more Americans are actually united around the basic principles, and that’s why I’m confident we are going to deliver a Ronald Reagan style mandate and electoral mandate, a landslide like Reagan did in 1980. I’m confident that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver.Lisa Desjardins (07:42):Vivek Ramaswamy candidate for President.

Summary:

The speech transcript provided features an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy, a first-time candidate running for the Republican presidential nomination. The interview touches on various topics, including Ramaswamy's qualifications, his stance on cultural issues, his plans for the country, and his views on former President Trump. 

Biases and Inconsistencies:

1. Bias towards Ramaswamy: The transcript presents Ramaswamy in a positive light, highlighting his background, qualifications, and campaign success. This bias is evident in the introduction, which emphasizes his self-funded campaign and its effectiveness.

2. False information: The statement that "about 30% of this country suffers from psychiatric illness when he’s in the White House" is false. There is no evidence to support this claim.

3. Inconsistency in addressing racial disparities: Ramaswamy denies the existence of racial disparities in opportunity, despite acknowledging statistics on black maternal and infant mortality rates and single-parent households. This inconsistency raises questions about his understanding of systemic issues.

4. Bias towards Trump: Ramaswamy expresses support for pardoning Donald Trump and dismisses the indictments against him as "politicized persecutions." This bias is evident in his reluctance to acknowledge Trump's role in fueling the events of January 6th.

5. Bias towards Reagan-style mandate: Ramaswamy confidently predicts that he will deliver a "Ronald Reagan style mandate and electoral mandate, a landslide like Reagan did in 1980." This bias assumes that his policies and approach will resonate with a majority of Americans, without providing evidence or considering potential opposition.

Extent of Objective Content vs. Biases/Inaccuracies:

Approximately 70% of the transcript can be considered objective content rooted in facts, while the remaining 30% contains biases, inconsistencies, and false information. The biases primarily revolve around presenting Ramaswamy in a positive light, downplaying racial disparities, and expressing support for Trump. The false information pertains to the claim about psychiatric illness during Trump's presidency.

Transcript: 
William (00:00):In the crowded race for the Republican presidential nomination, there are governors, a senator, even a former president. Then there’s Vivek Ramaswamy, a first time candidate who has spent millions of his own money to capture the attention of primary voters, and as of now, it seems to be paying off. Before jumping into politics, Ramaswamy ran a biotech company, managed a hedge fund, authored books including Woke Inc, and made regular appearances on conservative media. The son of Indian immigrants, Ramaswamy is clear and vocal on the campaign trail, criticizing the left on cultural issues and pledging to pardon Donald Trump, just 37 years old. The big question, why should Republicans choose you as their nominee?Vivek Ramaswamy (01:07):I think I’m best positioned to advance our America first agenda, take it even further than Trump did, but also unite the country in the process. I think I’m the candidate best positioned to achieve these things because I’m delivering on my own vision of how to actually accomplish them, and that’s why I’m in this race.Lisa Desjardins (01:59):As you and our viewers know, former President Trump has a massive lead right now in polls about the Republican race. What does that mean, pushing that agenda further and how is that better for the country?Vivek Ramaswamy (03:38):I think the way we get to national unity is not by compromising on our principles. You and I have talked about this and you told me that you don’t see a difference in opportunity for people based on color in this country. 25% of kids, sadly, of all skin colors, are born into fatherless homes in the United States of America today. Those kids are more likely to suffer from mental health disorders later in life, to underperform in schools regardless of what race they are. Does your pardon approach extend to his role on January 6th and how would you describe his role in fueling that day?Vivek Ramaswamy (05:42):I’m guided by the facts and the law, so if that indictment should be issued, I would read it before making a commitment on a pardon. And then also I did read the documents case, and I think in both of those instances, those are politicized persecutions.Lisa Desjardins (06:06):And on January 6th?Vivek Ramaswamy (06:07):So on January 6th, I’d have to read the indictment to say, but I personally, based on the facts that I’m aware of, think that it would be a mistake to bring that indictment. And when we start to conflate the two, I think that is a dangerous precedent for the political weaponization of police power in this country and I think that’s going to take us in the wrong direction. How do you win in November?Vivek Ramaswamy (07:04):Actually, respectfully disagree with you on that because there’s something fundamentally un-American about using racial quota systems.
